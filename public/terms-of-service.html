				<h2>Premium Subscriptions</h2>
				<p><u>Recurring Billing.</u> By purchasing a Premium subscription, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method on a recurring (e.g., monthly or yearly) basis for the applicable Premium subscription charge. Your payment to WeAreDevs will automatically renew at the end of your applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period.</p>
				<br>
				<p><u>Price Changes.</u> WeAreDevs may change the price for Premium subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Premium subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use Premium after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from Premium prior to the price change going into effect. We don’t want to charge you for something you don’t want, though, so if you cancel within 14 days of any price increases, you may request a refund by emailing contact@wearedevs.net.</p>
				<br>
				<p><u>Cancellation.</u> You may cancel your Premium subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to Premium through the end of the current subscription period. If you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. At our sole discretion, however, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members. You may cancel from the billing tab in your account manager.</p>
